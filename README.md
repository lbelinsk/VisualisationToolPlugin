Visualise Threads using HPE instrumented APK

This is my final project for my bachelors degree at the Technion.
The project has been supervised by Amichai Nitzan from HPE.

Motivation:
Android applications need to be very efficient and run very fast. But on the other hand, Android developers tend to open a lot of threads of execution, sometimes unknowingly.
There are almost no tools that can help a developer understand where the bottlenecks in a multi-threaded application in Android are.

Solution:
A plug-in for Android Studio which will display the Threads' state during each performed action.
